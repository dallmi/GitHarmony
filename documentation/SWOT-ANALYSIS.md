## 🏁 CONCLUSION

The current tool has a **solid foundation** but is missing **critical enterprise PM capabilities** that differentiate good project managers from great ones. The highest-value additions are:

1. **PowerPoint Export** - Unlock stakeholder communication
2. **Executive Dashboard** - Enable C-level visibility
3. **Dependency Graph** - Prevent cascading delays
4. **Risk Register** - Shift from reactive to proactive
5. **Predictive Analytics** - Replace guesswork with data

Implementing **Tier 1 features alone** would create **10-15 hours/week** of time savings per PM, transforming the tool from "nice to have" to "mission critical."
